## Code Structure & Explanation

### 1. **dashboard_api.php (Backend API)**
- **Purpose:** Acts as the bridge between the MySQL database and the dashboard frontend.
- **How it works:**
  - Receives requests from the dashboard (via AJAX/fetch in JS).
  - Runs SQL queries to fetch counts, sums, top records, and recent data from each table.
  - Returns all results as a single JSON object, structured for easy use by the frontend.
- **Key Functions:**
  - `getCount($pdo, $table)`: Returns the total number of records in a table.
  - `getTop5Customers($pdo)`: Returns the top 5 customers by credit limit.
  - `getRecentOrders($pdo)`: Returns the 5 most recent orders with customer info.
  - `getLargestPayment($pdo)`: Returns the largest payment and the customer who made it.
  - ...and more for each widget.
- **Why:** This keeps all business logic and data processing in one place, making the dashboard fast and secure.

### 2. **dashboard.js (Frontend Logic)**
- **Purpose:** Handles all dynamic behavior and data visualization in the dashboard.
- **How it works:**
  - On page load or when you click **Refresh All Data**, it fetches the latest data from `dashboard_api.php`.
  - Updates all stat cards, widgets, and charts with the new data.
  - Uses Chart.js to render interactive charts (bar, line, doughnut, etc.).
  - Handles UI features like dark/light mode, widget collapsing, and customization panel.
- **Key Functions:**
  - `fetchDataAndUpdate()`: Fetches data from the API and updates the dashboard.
  - `updateDashboard(data)`: Updates all widgets and charts with new data.
  - `renderChart(...)`: Renders a chart in a widget using Chart.js.
  - Event listeners for refresh, theme toggle, and widget customization.
- **Why:** Separates data logic from presentation, making the dashboard easy to maintain and extend.

### 3. **dashboard.html (Frontend Structure)**
- **Purpose:** Provides the structure and layout for the dashboard.
- **How it works:**
  - Contains all the containers for stat cards, widgets, and controls.
  - Loads the CSS for styling and JS for interactivity.
- **Why:** Clean HTML structure makes it easy to understand and modify the dashboard layout.

### 4. **dashboard.css (Styling)**
- **Purpose:** Makes the dashboard visually appealing and responsive.
- **How it works:**
  - Styles the stat cards, widgets, charts, and all UI elements.
  - Supports both light and dark mode.
- **Why:** Good styling ensures the dashboard is easy to read and present.
